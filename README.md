# Paper Implementations Hub

Welcome to my Paper Implementations Hub! This repository serves as a central location where I document and implement various research papers that I study and analyze. The implementations span across multiple domains of computer science and quantum computing.

## üîç Areas of Focus

- **Machine Learning & AI**
  - Transformer Architectures
  - Domain-grounding via XAI methods
  - SLMs & Trustworthy ML models

- **Quantum Computing**
  - Quantum Error Correction based on Circuit Cutting
  - Various Topology Implementations for Quantum Communication
  - Quantum Algorithms and Protocols

## üì∫ Video Explanations

For the majority of the paper implementations, I create accompanying YouTube videos that cover:
- Detailed walkthrough of the implementation process
- My thought process and decision-making while coding
- In-depth explanations using mathematical formulas and visualizations
- Practical insights and challenges encountered

## üóÇÔ∏è Repository Structure

Each implementation is organized in its own directory with:
- Source code
- Documentation
- Links to the original papers
- References to corresponding video explanations (when available)

## üéØ Purpose

The main goals of this repository are to:
1. Document my journey through various research papers
2. Provide practical implementations of theoretical concepts
3. Share knowledge through code and video explanations
4. Create a resource for others interested in these topics

Stay tuned for regular updates as I continue to add more implementations and explanations!

## üìù Note

This is an active repository that will grow over time as I explore more papers and implement their concepts. Feel free to watch, star, or fork this repository if you're interested in following along with my implementations and explanations.
